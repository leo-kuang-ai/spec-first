# `autofix_class` rubric (personas)

`autofix_class` describes the **intrinsic shape** of follow-up work — it is classification signal, **not an apply gate or permission**. The orchestrator-owned run-local `mutation_policy` is authoritative: ordinary/default review is `report-only`, explicit `review-and-fix` may resolve to `apply-fixes`, and `mode:agent` always remains report-only with caller-owned apply. The class informs *what to do first* and *what to flag*; it never decides whether the current run may mutate.

| `autofix_class` | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| `gated_auto` | A concrete change is proposed in `suggested_fix`. Callers may apply after their own judgment. |
| `manual` | Actionable work that needs design input or a decision before code changes. Include `suggested_fix` when you can propose a defensible default. |
| `advisory` | Report-only — learnings, residual risk, rollout notes. |

## Persona guidance

- Prefer `gated_auto` when you can write a defensible `suggested_fix` for a localized change.
- Use `manual` when the right fix depends on product intent, architecture, or cross-cutting refactors.
- Use `advisory` when nothing breaks if left unfixed but the observation has value.
- Do **not** emit `safe_auto` — callers decide what to apply; reviewers classify and propose.

## Owner field

| `owner` | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `downstream-resolver` | Caller or human should act after review. |
| `human` | Judgment required before implementation. |
| `release` | Operational / rollout follow-up. |

Do not use `review-fixer`.

## Severity Scale

All reviewers use P0-P3:

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **P0** | Critical breakage, exploitable vulnerability, data loss/corruption | Must fix before merge |
| **P1** | High-impact defect likely hit in normal usage, breaking contract | Should fix |
| **P2** | Moderate issue with meaningful downside (edge case, perf regression, maintainability trap) | Fix if straightforward |
| **P3** | Low-impact, narrow scope, minor improvement | User's discretion |

## Action Routing

Severity answers **urgency**. `autofix_class` and `owner` are **signal** describing follow-up shape for callers — not apply permission or an apply gate. Ordinary/default review reports. Only explicit `mutation_policy: apply-fixes` can enter Stage 5c, and `mode:agent` never mutates.

| `autofix_class` | Default owner | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| `gated_auto` | `downstream-resolver` or `human` | Concrete `suggested_fix` proposed; caller applies after judgment |
| `manual` | `downstream-resolver` or `human` | Actionable work needing design input or handoff |
| `advisory` | `human` or `release` | Report-only — learnings, rollout notes, residual risk |

Routing rules:

- **Synthesis owns the final route.** Persona-provided routing metadata is input, not the last word.
- **Choose the more conservative route on disagreement.** A merged finding may move from `gated_auto` to `manual`, but never widen without stronger evidence.
- **Reject `safe_auto` and `review-fixer` if present** — drop the finding or remap to `gated_auto` / `downstream-resolver` during synthesis.
- **`requires_verification: true` means any caller-applied fix needs targeted tests or follow-up validation.**
