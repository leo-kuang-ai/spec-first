# Ideation scope gates

### Phase 0: Resume and Scope

**Refine-vs-generate check (run before anything else in this phase).** If the user already holds one idea and asks to refine, converge, scope, or turn it into requirements, that is `spec-brainstorm`'s work, not ideation: stop and point the user to `spec-brainstorm`; do not run brainstorm-flavored questioning or requirement convergence inside this workflow. This workflow starts only when the user wants candidate directions generated and evaluated.

When the subject, mode, and format are already clear from the prompt, resolve this phase in one pass and move on — the gates below exist for ambiguity, not ceremony.

Output resolution and resume are owned by `references/output-mode.md`; read it before this phase.

#### 0.2 Subject-Identification Gate

Before classifying mode or dispatching any grounding, check whether the subject of ideation is identifiable. Every downstream agent — grounding and ideation — needs to know what it's working on. If the subject is ambiguous enough that reasonable sub-agents would diverge on what the topic even is (bare words like `improvements`, `ideas`, `birthday cakes`, `vacation destinations`), the output will be scattered.

**Questioning principles (apply in this phase and in 0.4):**

- Questions exist only to supply what sub-agents need to operate: an identifiable subject (this phase) and enough context for the agent to say something specific about it (0.4, elsewhere modes only). Nothing else.
- Never ask about solution direction, constraints, audience, tone, success criteria, or anything that characterizes the subject — those belong to `spec-brainstorm`.
- Always keep "Surprise me" (letting the agent decide the focus) as a real option, not a fallback for when the user can't name a subject. Ideation is allowed to be greenfield by design.
- Stop as soon as the subject is identifiable or the user has delegated to "Surprise me." More than 3 total questions across 0.2 and 0.4 is a smell that ideation is not the right workflow — consider suggesting `spec-brainstorm`.

**Detection — issue-tracker intent (repo mode only; subject-identifying).**

Issue-tracker intent requires an explicit reference to the tracker or to reports filed in it. Trigger only when the prompt uses phrases like `github issues`, `open issues`, `issue patterns`, `issue themes`, `what users are reporting`, or `bug reports` — the subject is "issues in the tracker." Proceed to 0.3 with issue-tracker intent flagged.

Do NOT trigger on arguments that merely mention bugs as a focus: `bug in auth`, `fix the login issue`, `the signup bug`, `top 3 bugs in authentication` — these are focus hints on regular ideation, not requests to analyze the issue tracker. A bare `bugs` with no tracker phrasing is handled by the vagueness check below, not here.

When combined (e.g., `top 3 issue themes in authentication`, `biggest bug reports about checkout`): detect issue-tracker intent first, volume override in 0.5, remainder is the focus hint. The focus narrows which issues matter; the volume override controls survivor count.

**Detection — subject identifiability.**

The test: would a reader, seeing only this prompt, know what subject the agent should ideate on? Vagueness is about what the words *refer to*, not phrase length: `browser sniff` is two words but plausibly names a feature (identifiable — proceed to 0.3); `quick wins` is two words but names only a quality (vague — ask the scope question). A prompt that refers to a catch-all quality, category, or placeholder (`improvements`, `bugs` alone, an empty prompt) is vague; one that names or plausibly names a specific feature, concept, document, flow, or topic is identifiable, in any domain.

**Being inside a repo does not settle vagueness.** `improvements` in any repo is still scattered across DX, reliability, features, docs, tests, architecture. The repo provides material for grounding *after* a subject is settled, not the subject itself. Do not silently interpret a vague prompt as "about this repo" and proceed.

**Genuine ambiguity (repo mode).** When real doubt remains on a short phrase, one cheap check settles it: Glob for the phrase in filenames, or Grep for it in README/docs. Any repo footprint → identifiable; none and still vague → ask. When in doubt otherwise, err toward asking — one question is trivial compared to dispatching a dozen agents on a scattered interpretation.

**The scope question.**

Ask via the platform's blocking question tool per Interaction Method above — never silently skip.

- **Stem:** "What should the agent ideate about?"
- **Options:**
  - "Specify a subject the agent should ideate on"
  - "Surprise me — let the agent decide what to focus on"
  - "Cancel — let me rephrase"

Routing:

- **Specify** → accept the user's follow-up as the subject. Re-apply the identifiability check once. If still ambiguous, ask once more with "Surprise me" still on the menu. Do not cascade toward specificity about *how* to solve — only about *what* the subject is.
- **Surprise me** → mark the run as **surprise-me mode**. The agent will discover subjects from Phase 1 material rather than carry a user-specified subject. This is a first-class mode — it changes how Phase 1 scans and how Phase 2 sub-agents operate (see those phases). **Dispatch routing for surprise-me is deterministic:** if CWD is inside a git repo, route to repo-grounded (the codebase supplies substance); otherwise route to elsewhere-software and require Phase 0.4 to collect at least one piece of substance (URL, description, draft, or paste) before dispatching — "surprise me" outside a repo is only viable once the user has supplied something to surprise them about. Skip Decision 1/2 in Phase 0.3: with no user subject there is no prompt content to weigh, and surprise-me never routes to elsewhere-non-software (no way to infer naming/narrative/personal intent without a subject). The user can correct by interrupting and re-invoking with a named subject.
- **Cancel** → exit cleanly. Narrate that the user can rephrase and re-invoke.

#### 0.3 Mode Classification

Classify the **subject of ideation** (settled in 0.2) into one of three modes for dispatch routing. A user inside any repo can ideate about something unrelated to that repo; a user in `/tmp` can ideate about code they hold in their head.

**Surprise-me short-circuit.** When Phase 0.2 routed to surprise-me mode, skip the two-decision classification below and use the deterministic rule stated in 0.2: repo-grounded when CWD is inside a git repo, elsewhere-software otherwise. The ambiguity-confirmation step at the end of this section also does not fire for surprise-me — there is no user subject to be ambiguous about. State the chosen mode in one sentence and proceed to 0.4.

For specified subjects, make two sequential binary decisions, enumerating negative signals at each:

**Decision 1 — repo-grounded vs elsewhere.** Weigh prompt content first, topic-repo coherence second, and CWD repo presence as supporting evidence only.

- Positive signals for **repo-grounded**: prompt references repo files, code, architecture, modules, tests, or workflows; topic is clearly bounded by the current codebase. Issue-tracker intent from 0.2 is always repo-grounded.
- Negative signals (push toward **elsewhere**): prompt names things absent from the repo (pricing, naming, narrative, business model, personal decisions, brand, content, market positioning); topic is creative, business, or personal with no code surface.

**Decision 2 (only fires if Decision 1 = elsewhere) — software vs non-software.** Classify by whether the *subject* of ideation is a software artifact or system, not by where the individual ideas will eventually land. If the topic concerns a product, app, SaaS, web/mobile UI, feature, page, or service, it is **elsewhere-software** — even when the ideas themselves are about copy, UX, CRO, pricing, onboarding, visual design, or positioning *for that software product*. **Elsewhere-non-software** is reserved for topics with no software surface at all: company or brand naming (independent of product), narrative and creative writing, personal decisions, non-digital business strategy, physical-product design.

Contrast pair: "Improve conversion on our sign-up page" → elsewhere-software (the subject is a page, even though the ideas may be copy or CRO); "Name my new coffee shop" → elsewhere-non-software (the subject is a brand with no software surface).

State the inferred approach in one sentence at the top, using plain language the user will recognize. Never print the internal taxonomy label (`repo-grounded`, `elsewhere-software`, `elsewhere-non-software`) to the user — those names are for routing only. Adapt the template below to the actual topic; pick a domain word from the topic itself (e.g., "landing page", "onboarding flow", "naming", "career decision") instead of a mode label.

- **Repo-grounded:** "Treating this as a topic in this codebase — about X."
- **Elsewhere-software:** "Treating this as a product/software topic outside this repo — about X."
- **Elsewhere-non-software:** "Treating this as a [naming | narrative | business | personal] topic — about X."

Do not prescribe correction phrases ("say X to switch"). State the inferred mode plainly and proceed. If the user disagrees, they will correct in their own words or interrupt to re-invoke — reclassify and re-run any affected routing when that happens.

**Active confirmation on mode ambiguity.** Only fire when mode classification is genuinely ambiguous *after* 0.2 settled the subject — e.g., "our docs" could mean repo docs (repo-grounded) or public marketing docs (elsewhere-software). Most subjects settled in 0.2 classify cleanly here. When ambiguous, ask one confirmation question via the blocking tool with two self-contained labels naming the two candidate interpretations in plain language (e.g., "Treat as repo docs in this codebase" vs "Treat as public marketing docs") — never leak internal mode names. Otherwise the one-sentence inferred-mode statement is sufficient; do not ask.

**Routing rule (non-software mode).** When Decision 2 = non-software, still run Phase 1 Elsewhere-mode grounding with user-context synthesis. Add web research only when `external_research_authorization: authorized`; missing authority removes the web-research role regardless of mode or depth. Learnings-researcher is skipped by default in this mode — the CWD's `docs/solutions/` rarely transfers to naming, narrative, personal, or non-digital business topics; see Phase 1 for the full rationale. Then load `references/universal-ideation.md` and follow it in place of Phase 2's software frame dispatch and the Phase 5 menu narrative. This load is non-optional — the file contains the domain-agnostic generation frames, critique rubric, and wrap-up menu that replace Phase 2 and the post-ideation menu for this mode, and none of those details live in this main body. Improvising from memory produces the wrong facilitation for non-software topics. Do not run the repo-specific codebase scan at any point. The deliverable is auto-written here too (per `references/post-ideation-workflow.md` Phase 4); the auto-written local file remains the intact record regardless of what the user does with it afterward.

#### 0.4 Context-Substance Gate (Elsewhere Modes Only)

Skip in repo mode — the repo provides the substance Phase 1 agents work from. In elsewhere modes (both software and non-software), Phase 1 agents depend on user-supplied context for substance. A bare prompt with no description, URL, or artifact leaves the user-context-synthesis agent with nothing to synthesize and weakens web research's relevance.

Apply the discrimination test: would swapping one piece of the user's stated context for a contrasting alternative materially change which ideas survive? If yes, context is load-bearing — proceed. If no, ask 1-3 narrowly chosen questions focused on **supplying substance, not characterizing the subject**:

- A URL or file to read
- A brief description of the current state
- A paste of an existing draft or brief

Build on what the user already provided rather than starting from a template. Default to free-form questions; use single-select only when the answer space is small and discrete. After each answer, re-apply the test before asking another. Stop on dismissive responses ("idk just go") — treat genuine "no context" answers as real answers and note context is thin in the summary so Phase 2 can compensate with broader generation.

**Surprise-me exception.** When the run is in surprise-me mode and routed to elsewhere-software (per 0.2's deterministic routing for no-repo CWDs), at least one piece of substance is required — there is no subject AND no repo, so Phase 1 and 2 agents would have nothing to discover subjects from. Dismissive responses are not acceptable here; if the user still has no context after one ask, tell them the run needs a URL, description, or paste to proceed and end cleanly so they can re-invoke with material.

When the user provides rich context up front (a paste, a brief, an existing draft, a URL), confirm understanding in one line and skip this step entirely.

If this step materially changes the topic (not just adds context but shifts the subject), re-run 0.2 and 0.3 against the refined scope before dispatching Phase 1 — classify on what's actually being ideated on, not the scope at first read.

#### 0.5 Interpret Focus and Volume

Infer two things from the argument and any intake so far:

- **Focus context** — concept, path, constraint, or open-ended
- **Volume override** — any hint that changes candidate or survivor counts

Default volume:

- each ideation frame yields about 6-8 ideas (~36-48 raw across the six frames in the default path, or ~24-32 across 4 frames in issue-tracker mode; roughly 25-30 survivors after dedupe in the default path and fewer in the 4-frame path)
- keep the top 5-7 survivors

Honor clear overrides such as:

- `top 3`
- `100 ideas`
- `raise the bar`

**Depth override.** `go deep` (or equivalent) opts into maximum depth deliberately: every ideation agent moves to the ceiling tier, the Phase 2 verification read budget doubles, and Phase 3 adds a second critic. The default is the mixed-tier fleet — users opt into top-tier cost explicitly rather than inheriting it from whichever model the conversation happens to run on.

**Tactical scope detection.** Parse the focus hint and intake for `polish`, `typo`, `typos`, `quick wins`, `small improvements`, `cleanup`, or `small fixes`. Resolve collisions before any downstream budget or waiver: `go deep` suppresses tactical scope entirely, even when a tactical signal was detected. Preserve this resolved state on fallback; do not re-derive it from raw prompt words.

**Tactical's dials:** 3-4 ideas per frame; 2-3 verification reads per agent; at most 3 axes and one scout per axis (at most 3); meeting-test waived in both the generator and verifier payloads. Keep basis verification. Tactical changes no fleet size, frame set, or model tier, and never packs extra frames into one worker: the read budget is per agent, not per frame. Issue themes, Surprise me, or universal depth still own their respective surface and fleet; tactical supplies only these dials unless suppressed by `go deep`.

An explicit raw candidate total controls the per-frame split across the resolved frame set; an explicit survivor count controls the final cut. Preserve both on issue fallback and recompute only the fleet and per-frame split for the new surface.

Use reasonable interpretation rather than formal parsing.

#### 0.6 Cost Transparency Notice

Before Phase 1, derive and record `external_research_authorization: authorized | missing`. It is `authorized` only when the current user or visible upstream handoff explicitly requests web/external/provider research or issue-tracker evidence for this run. General ideation, `go deep`, surprise-me mode, tool availability, and a prior run do not grant it. Missing or explicitly denied authority records `external_research_authorization_missing` and removes web research and issue intelligence without weakening current-source grounding. Every authorized external result carries provenance, freshness, and limitations and remains advisory until its cited source is rechecked.

Surface one short cost line from actual execution decisions, never a memorized total. Name grounding roles from references/grounding.md, scouts from references/decomposition.md, software frames from references/divergent-ideation.md, and universal depth from references/universal-ideation.md. Count only a decision already resolved; otherwise name the leg as conditional.

Include only authorized external research; skip phrases remove it even when tools or a cache exist. Include issue SCAN plus a conditional CLUSTER call, opt-in Slack, one distiller per large research artifact (small artifacts add no worker), and up to two conditional recovery roles. Cache reuse, eligible issue signal, actual axes, and universal depth may be unknown before Phase 1: do not pre-subtract them or substitute the default software fleet. Quick/Standard universal generation has no ideation workers. Include a second critic when go deep is active.

Authorized-dispatch examples name only derived legs, for example: codebase scan + learnings + conditional evidence scouts + the resolved ideation fleet + basis verification. When authorization or capability is missing, describe role lenses inline/serial with dispatch_authorization_missing, subagent_capability_missing, or worker_capability_unproven as applicable, not agents; no independent diversity or fresh-context claim. Dispatch authority never substitutes for external research authority.

The line is informational; users do not need to acknowledge it.
