# Topic-Surface Decomposition

Read after grounding and before deciding whether decomposition is applicable. Dispatch instructions inherit SKILL.md authorization and capability boundaries; inline execution preserves evidence coverage without claiming independent agents.

### Phase 1.5: Topic-Surface Decomposition

Before dispatching frame agents in Phase 2, decompose the topic into 3-5 orthogonal **axes** that name *what aspects of the subject to think about*. Phase 2 frames determine *how to think* (the lens); axes determine *what to think on* (the surface). Without an explicit axis list, parallel frames tend to converge on whichever interpretation of the subject is most salient at first read — other parts of the surface go unexamined regardless of how many frames run. Lens diversity alone does not produce surface coverage.

The axis analysis itself is a single orchestrator-side pass against the grounding summary already in context — no additional grounding read, no user-facing question. The evidence scouts below are the only dispatch in this phase.

**Axis criteria:**

- **3-5 axes**, capped at 3 when tactical scope is active. Fewer than 3 means the topic is atomic — skip per the rule below. More than 5 fragments dispatch and produces thin coverage on each.
- **Orthogonal.** A single idea should naturally fall on one axis, not span multiple. Merge axes that overlap heavily.
- **Derived from grounding.** The grounding summary contains the substance the axes name; do not pick axes from a generic template (e.g., "discovery / engagement / retention" applied to every topic).
- **At the same level.** Don't mix "the entire pricing page" with "the $9.99 tier copy" in the same list.
- **Named in the topic's language.** "Send mechanics" beats "outbound flow optimization." Use words a reader of the topic would recognize, not meta-language about ideation.

**Worked examples (illustrative, not a template — derive from actual grounding):**

| Topic | Axes |
|---|---|
| Social sharing of crossfire and convergence pages | Send mechanics; discovery (receive side); arrival/dwell experience; compounding over time; actor types (first-party, expert, reader) |
| Improve our authentication system | Sign-in flow; session management; account recovery; permissions; identity providers |
| Dark mode for our app | Visual surfaces; toggle UX; system-preference detection; asset variants; edge cases (third-party content) |
| Cache invalidation in the data layer | Trigger surfaces; coordination across replicas; staleness tolerance per data class; observability of invalidation events |

Axes may describe actors or compounding over time, not just components. If the result is merely a directory listing, reconsider whether it covers the subject's meaningful surfaces.

**Skip condition.** Some subjects are atomic and resist meaningful decomposition — a single string output (a name, a tagline), a narrowly-scoped tactical fix ("the typo on line 47 of README"), or a topic where the candidate axes *are* the deliverable (e.g., "what surface should the API expose?"). When 3+ orthogonal axes that pass the criteria above cannot be generated, skip decomposition. Note `Decomposition skipped — atomic subject` in the grounding summary so the artifact records the choice.

**Surprise-me skip.** In surprise-me mode there is no settled subject to decompose — different frames will surface different subjects in Phase 2, and the cross-cutting synthesis step there serves the analogous coverage role. Skip Phase 1.5 in surprise-me mode and note `Decomposition skipped — surprise-me mode` in the grounding summary.

**Evidence scouts (repo mode, when axes exist).** Decomposition names what to look at; scouts gather what is actually there. The Phase 1 scan is an orientation gist — too thin for ideation agents to quote from — so use one extraction-tier role per axis (max 5; max 3 when tactical scope is active). Never retain more axes than scouts. Dispatch in bounded parallel only when authorized and capable; otherwise gather the same dossiers serially. Pass each scout the absolute `<scratch-dir>` path from Phase 1 and a kebab-case slug for its axis, with this prompt:

> Gather evidence about **{axis}** in this repo, scoped to {focus/subject}. Search first with the native file-search and content-search tools, then read targeted sections — budget ~20 reads, preferring ranges over whole files. Write an **evidence dossier** to `{scratch-dir}/evidence-{axis-slug}.md`: at most 150 lines of verbatim quotes and short code snippets, each with a `file:line` pointer, covering pain points, workarounds, TODO/FIXME markers, surprising patterns, and leverage points on this axis. Extraction only — quote what the repo says; do not interpret, theme, or propose ideas. If the axis has little footprint, write less rather than padding. Return only a gist: 3-5 lines summarizing what the dossier holds, plus its absolute path and entry count.

Append the returned gists (with dossier paths) — not the dossier contents — to the consolidated grounding summary under `Evidence: <axis>`. The dossier files are the evidence layer Phase 2 agents read and cite from; keeping their bulk out of the orchestrator's context is the point of the file handoff, so do not read them into the main session. Skip scouts when decomposition was skipped (atomic subjects rarely need deep evidence — Phase 2 verification reads cover them), in surprise-me mode, and in elsewhere modes (no repo to scout; user-supplied context and web research are the grounding there).

Append the axis list (or skip-reason) to the consolidated grounding summary under a section labeled `Topic axes`. Phase 2 reads this section to thread axes into sub-agent prompts; Phase 3 uses it for axis-spread scoring; the Phase 4 artifact includes it under Grounding Context (per `references/ideation-sections.md`).
