## Phase 1: Investigate Candidate Learnings

For each learning in scope, read it, cross-reference its claims against the current codebase, and form a recommendation.

A learning has several dimensions that can independently go stale. Surface-level checks catch the obvious drift, but staleness often hides deeper:

- **References** — do the file paths, class names, and modules it mentions still exist or have they moved?
- **Recommended solution** — does the fix still match how the code actually works today? A renamed file with a completely different implementation pattern is not just a path update.
- **Code examples** — if the learning includes code snippets, do they still reflect the current implementation?
- **Related docs** — are cross-referenced learnings and patterns still present and consistent?
- **Auto memory** (Claude Code only) — does the injected auto-memory block in your system prompt contain entries in the same problem domain? Scan that block directly. If the block is absent, skip this dimension. A memory note describing a different approach than what the learning recommends is a supplementary drift signal.
- **Overlap** — while investigating, note when another doc in scope covers the same problem domain, references the same files, or recommends a similar solution. For each overlap, record: the two file paths, which dimensions overlap (problem, solution, root cause, files, prevention), and which doc appears broader or more current. These signals feed Phase 1.75 (Document-Set Analysis).
- **Vocabulary** — note domain terms the learning cites (entities, named processes, status concepts with project-specific meaning). For each term: does it appear in `CONCEPTS.md`? If yes, does the definition still match how the code uses the term? If no, flag the term for Phase 4.5 to add or bootstrap. Do not edit `CONCEPTS.md` during investigation — just collect the signal centrally.

Match investigation depth to the learning's specificity — a learning referencing exact file paths and code snippets needs more verification than one describing a general principle.

### Drift Classification: Update vs Replace

The critical distinction is whether the drift is **cosmetic** (references moved but the solution is the same) or **substantive** (the solution itself changed):

- **Update territory** — file paths moved, classes renamed, links broke, metadata drifted, but the core recommended approach is still how the code works. `spec-compound-refresh` fixes these directly.
- **Replace territory** — the recommended solution conflicts with current code, the architectural approach changed, or the pattern is no longer the preferred way. This means a new learning needs to be written. An authorized replacement subagent may draft the successor following `spec-compound`'s document format, using the investigation evidence already gathered, but it never writes the tracked successor. Without authorized dispatch, the orchestrator composes the replacement inline or serially. In every path the orchestrator is the sole tracked-file writer, and the successor must pass the same `source_refs` / `invalidation_condition` promotion gate as a new `spec-compound` learning.

**The boundary:** if you find yourself rewriting the solution section or changing what the learning recommends, stop — that is Replace, not Update.

**Memory-sourced drift signals** are supplementary, not primary. A memory note describing a different approach does not alone justify Replace or Delete. Use memory signals to:
- Corroborate codebase-sourced drift (strengthens the case for Replace)
- Prompt deeper investigation when codebase evidence is borderline
- Add context to the evidence report ("(auto memory [claude]) notes suggest approach X may have changed since this learning was written")

In headless mode, memory-only drift (no codebase corroboration) should result in stale-marking, not action.

### Judgment Guidelines

Three guidelines that are easy to get wrong:

1. **Contradiction = strong Replace signal.** If the learning's recommendation conflicts with current code patterns or a recently verified fix, that is not a minor drift — the learning is actively misleading. Classify as Replace.
2. **Age alone is not a stale signal.** A 2-year-old learning that still matches current code is fine. Only use age as a prompt to inspect more carefully.
3. **Check for successors before deleting.** Before recommending Replace or Delete, look for newer learnings, pattern docs, PRs, or issues covering the same problem space. If successor evidence exists, prefer Replace over Delete so readers are directed to the newer guidance.

## Phase 1.5: Investigate Pattern Docs

After reviewing the underlying learning docs, investigate any relevant pattern docs under `docs/solutions/patterns/`.

Pattern docs are high-leverage — a stale pattern is more dangerous than a stale individual learning because future work may treat it as broadly applicable guidance. Evaluate whether the generalized rule still holds given the refreshed state of the learnings it depends on.

A pattern doc with no clear supporting learnings is a stale signal — investigate carefully before keeping it unchanged.

## Phase 1.75: Document-Set Analysis

After investigating individual docs, step back and evaluate the document set as a whole. The goal is to catch problems that only become visible when comparing docs to each other — not just to reality.

### Overlap Detection

For docs that share the same module, component, tags, or problem domain, compare them across these dimensions:

- **Problem statement** — do they describe the same underlying problem?
- **Solution shape** — do they recommend the same approach, even if worded differently?
- **Referenced files** — do they point to the same code paths?
- **Prevention rules** — do they repeat the same prevention bullets?
- **Root cause** — do they identify the same root cause?

High overlap across 3+ dimensions is a strong Consolidate signal. The question to ask: "Would a future maintainer need to read both docs to get the current truth, or is one mostly repeating the other?"

### Supersession Signals

Detect "older narrow precursor, newer canonical doc" patterns:

- A newer doc covers the same files, same workflow, and broader runtime behavior than an older doc
- An older doc describes a specific incident that a newer doc generalizes into a pattern
- Two docs recommend the same fix but the newer one has better context, examples, or scope

When a newer doc clearly subsumes an older one, the older doc is a consolidation candidate — its unique content (if any) should be merged into the newer doc, and the older doc should be deleted.

### Canonical Doc Identification

For each topic cluster (docs sharing a problem domain), identify which doc is the **canonical source of truth**:

- Usually the most recent, broadest, most accurate doc in the cluster
- The one a maintainer should find first when searching for this topic
- The one that other docs should point to, not duplicate

All other docs in the cluster are either:
- **Distinct** — they cover a meaningfully different sub-problem and have independent retrieval value. Keep them separate.
- **Subsumed** — their unique content fits as a section in the canonical doc. Consolidate.
- **Redundant** — they add nothing the canonical doc doesn't already say. Delete.

### Retrieval-Value Test

Before recommending that two docs stay separate, apply this test: "If a maintainer searched for this topic six months from now, would having these as separate docs improve discoverability, or just create drift risk?"

Separate docs earn their keep only when:
- They cover genuinely different sub-problems that someone might search for independently
- They target different audiences or contexts (e.g., one is about debugging, another about prevention)
- Merging them would create an unwieldy doc that is harder to navigate than two focused ones

If none of these apply, prefer consolidation. Two docs covering the same ground will eventually drift apart and contradict each other — that is worse than a slightly longer single doc.

### Cross-Doc Conflict Check

Look for outright contradictions between docs in scope:
- Doc A says "always use approach X" while Doc B says "avoid approach X"
- Doc A references a file path that Doc B says was deprecated
- Doc A and Doc B describe different root causes for what appears to be the same problem

Contradictions between docs are more urgent than individual staleness — they actively confuse readers. Flag these for immediate resolution, either through Consolidate (if one is right and the other is a stale version of the same truth) or through targeted Update/Replace.

## Subagent Strategy

Before any investigation or replacement dispatch, record:

```yaml
worker_dispatch_authorization: authorized | missing
capability_probe: not_applicable | attempted | unavailable
worker_dispatch_capability: available | missing | unknown
worker_context_isolation: isolated | inherited | unknown
worker_model_override: supported | unsupported | unknown
worker_bounded_parallelism: supported | unsupported | unknown
```

`workflow invocation does not authorize dispatch`。只有当前用户或可见 upstream handoff 明确请求 subagent、delegated work、persona 或 parallel work 时才可派发；headless mode、scope size、permission settings 或本 Skill 被调用都不是授权。缺授权时不得探测 tool schema，固定为 `capability_probe: not_applicable` + `worker_dispatch_capability: unknown`，使用 main-thread/serial fallback 并记录 `dispatch_authorization_missing`。只有授权后才把 current-session registry/schema 作为 `provider_untrusted` evidence 检查：确认缺失时记录 `subagent_capability_missing`；surface 不可用、schema 不完整或候选不唯一时记录 `worker_capability_unproven`，均使用同一 fallback。隔离、模型覆盖和有界并发只取 live facts；required isolation 未满足时保持依赖 gate 打开，model unknown 时继承，parallelism unknown 时串行。记录 `worker_dispatch_outcome`。Inline fallback 不得声称 independent investigation coverage。

When dispatch is authorized and available, use subagents for context isolation when investigating multiple artifacts — not just because the task sounds complex. Otherwise choose the matching main-thread or serial approach with the same evidence contract:

| Approach | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Main thread only** | Small scope, short docs |
| **Sequential subagents** | 1-2 artifacts with many supporting files to read |
| **Parallel subagents** | 3+ truly independent artifacts with low overlap |
| **Batched subagents** | Broad sweeps — narrow scope first, then investigate in batches |

**When spawning an authorized subagent**, omit the `mode` parameter so the user's configured permission settings apply; those settings are execution conditions, not authorization. Include this instruction in its task prompt:

> Use dedicated file search and read tools (Glob, Grep, Read) for all investigation. Do NOT use shell commands (ls, find, cat, grep, test, bash) for file operations. This avoids permission prompts and is more reliable.
>
> Also scan the "user's auto-memory" block injected into your system prompt (Claude Code only). Check for notes related to the learning's problem domain. Report any memory-sourced drift signals separately from codebase-sourced evidence, tagged with "(auto memory [claude])" in the evidence section. If the block is not present in your context, skip this check.

There are two subagent roles:

1. **Investigation subagents** — read-only. They must not edit files, create successors, or delete anything. Each returns: file path, evidence, recommended action, confidence, and open questions. These can run in parallel when artifacts are independent.
2. **Replacement subagents** — draft one candidate successor and return its content or a run-local scratch reference. They never write tracked files, stage, commit, or delete. These run **one at a time, sequentially**; the orchestrator validates the draft and performs the tracked successor write, deletion, and metadata updates.

The orchestrator merges investigation results, detects contradictions, coordinates replacement subagents, and performs all deletions/metadata edits centrally. In interactive mode, it asks the user questions on ambiguous cases. In headless mode, it marks ambiguous cases as stale instead. If two artifacts overlap or discuss the same root issue, investigate them together rather than parallelizing.


### Required investigation prompt clauses

When an authorized investigation subagent is used, its prompt must also state:

> If the learning is knowledge-track and names or links a guidance file (a skill's `SKILL.md`, a runbook, or a root instruction file), read that named guidance and report any contradictory order or rule with both quotes and which side current code follows. Do not search the guidance layer for an unreferenced file, and do not edit it.
